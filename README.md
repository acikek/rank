# rank

Very simple rank system

## About

A simple command and config setup that provides a Denizen rank system and interop with a permissions plugin. Players are assigned the default rank when they join for the first time. The `rank` command assigns a rank to a player, that being themselves if none is provided.

* Permissions interop can be enabled or disabled with the `permissions` config key.
* The `ranks` map consists of rank ID keys and values for display name and permission group.
